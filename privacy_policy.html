<p>
We employ physical, electronic, and managerial measures, including education and training of our personnel, designed to provide the personal information in our possession with reasonable protection from accidental loss or destruction, improper use, alteration, or disclosure. Personal information collected or displayed through a Web site is protected in transit by industry standard encryption processes. However, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information accessible on or transmitted via the Internet.</p>
<p>
We process personal information in ways compatible with the purpose for which the personal information was collected, or as otherwise authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for such purposes, we take reasonable steps to make sure that personal information is accurate, complete, current, and otherwise reliable with regard to its intended use.</p>
<p>
If an individual becomes aware that personal information we maintain about that individual is inaccurate, or if an individual would like to update or review his or her personal information, the individual may contact us using the contact information below. As a security precaution, we may request that the individual provide identifying information such as name, address, birth date, and/or social security number. In addition, we may limit or deny access to personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor Agreement. In some circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee, where warranted, for access to personal information.</p>

<h2>Accountability and Enforcement</h2>
<p>
We monitor our adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles and a program administrator is available to address questions and concerns regarding our adherence. Maintenance for the program includes a statement, at least once a year, signed by our authorized representative, verifying our adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles.
With respect to any dispute relating to this notice that cannot be resolved through our internal processes, we will cooperate with competent European Union data protection authorities and comply with the advice of such authorities. In the event that we or such authorities determine that we did not comply with this notice, we will take appropriate steps to address any adverse effects and to promote future compliance.</p>

<h2>Amendment</h2>
<p>
We may amend this notice from time to time by posting a revised notice on this Web site, or a similar Web site that replaces this Web site.
</p>

<h2>Information Subject to Other Policies</h2>
<p>
We are committed to following the Safe Harbor Principles for all personal information, as that term is defined herein. Other information we receive may be subject to policies that may differ in some respects from the policies set forth in this notice. Certain of our email customers have their own privacy policies that apply specifically to those Web sites. Those policies may be accessed through the Web sites in question. Information relating to present or former Makesbridge Technology personnel is subject to our policies concerning personnel data privacy, which are available to present and former Makesbridge Technology personnel upon request.
